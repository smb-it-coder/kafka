### **Hands-on and Coding Questions**
38. Write a simple Kafka producer script in Node.js that sends JSON data to a topic.
39. Write a Kafka consumer in Node.js that processes messages in batches.
40. Implement error handling for a Kafka producer in Node.js.
41. Write code to monitor Kafka consumer lag in Node.js.

---

### **Scenario-based Questions**
42. If you need to process millions of messages per second, how would you design your Kafka setup?
43. How would you handle out-of-order messages in a Kafka consumer?
44. What happens if a consumer crashes after processing a message but before committing the offset? How would you handle this?
45. In a multi-region setup, how would you configure Kafka for low-latency message delivery?
